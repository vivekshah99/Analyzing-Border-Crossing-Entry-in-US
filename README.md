# Analyzing-Border-Crossing-Entry-in-US

# Introduction

For a country like United States of America with two major borders i.e. US-Canada and US-Mexico border, itâ€™s a big deal to maintain and handle data of entry exits at both points while considering various parameters. This border crossing entry data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics gives us an overview of inbound crossing at both border at port level. The data which is collected and provided by the US customs & protection at port levels. The main objective of this project is to basically analyse and find out that how both land borders inflow of the United States varies as per time, transportation modes and states. So basically, we want to understand about the massive number of people travelling into United States through these ports by which means of transport and at what particular timings. Also, check the lowest or highest number of people travelling and how they varied for the given time periods. Here, finding number of crossing per month and conclude with which month has more entries and which month has the least. Creating a word cloud for better and easy visualization. 

# Interpretation

1)	Looking at the border distance and comparing it between US-Canada and US-Mexico, we can conclude that US-Canada border stretches about 8800 kms, while US-Mexico is about 3000 kms. Thus, it showcases that United States allows more entry to Canadians than the Mexicans. 

2)	Secondly, as mentioned above that Canada border is bigger than Mexico border, which means that inbound entry of vehicles would be more from Canada and not from Mexico. It not only depends on inbound entry but to which particular locations/states they go in United States.

3)	But, after analysing the dataset it also showcases that Mexico has contributed highly towards inbound entry of vehicles than Canada. 

4)	There were different modes of transportation but after analysing the dataset we can conclude that personal vehicles and personal vehicles passengers were the top 2 leading categories for inbound entry into United States consistently for 12 years. 

5)	Last highlights of the dataset in correspondence to months where the inbound entry of vehicle was high were in the months of August and December. On the other hand February being the month with least number of entries.

6)	The border crossing entry inflow at both the borders was peaked in the year 1999, and then decreased bit gradually and became the least in the year 2011. But, now again there has been increase in entries gradually.

7)	 These overall interpretations will be useful for resource allocations at these borders.
